      <p class="subtitle is-size-5">As a developer, I remind myself everyday that my role in life is to “develop”. If
          I considered everything that I’ve ever worked on as completed, then my career
          title would make the least amount of sense, and should be changed to “finisher”.
          Whether it be a project that’s started or ourselves as people living day to day life.
          there always be something that we need to improve. This is why I’m passionate
          about what I do, because everyday I get a new opportunity to learn how to better
          myself in my career path and my life, while helping others do the same. It’s more
          than a job, it’s a lifestyle.</p>
